# Race-Day
Write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.  Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
